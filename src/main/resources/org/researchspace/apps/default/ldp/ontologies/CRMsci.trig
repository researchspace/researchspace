An instance of S20 Physical Feature also represents the place it occupies with respect to the surrounding matter. More precisely, it is the maximal real volume in space that an instance of S20 Physical Feature is occupying during its lifetime with respect to the default reference space relative to which the feature is at rest. In cases of features on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colors, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises activities of S4 Observation (substance) where an E39 Actor encounters an instance of E18 Physical Thing of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report.
In archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to enable inferences about the history of the E18 Physical Thing.
In Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”)."""@en .

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises a mass of matter in fluid form environmentally constraint in some persistent form allowing for identifying it for the management or research of material phenomena, such as a part of the sea, a river, the atmosphere or the milk in a bottle. Fluids are generally defined by the continuity criterion which is characteristic of their substance: their amorphous matter is continuous and tends to flow. Therefore, contiguous amounts of matter within a fluid body may stay contiguous or at least be locally spatially confined for a sufficiently long time in order to be temporarily identified and traced. This is a much weaker concept of stability of form than the one we would apply to what one would call a physical object. In general, an instance of Fluid Body may gain or lose matter over time through so-called sources or sinks in its surface, in contrast to physical things, which may lose or gain matter by exchange of pieces such as spare parts or corrosion."""@en .

The spatial extend of a S22 Segment of Matter is defined by humans usually because the constellation is subject to a specific interest for and investigations of the geometric arrangement of physical features or parts of them on or within the specified S22 Segment of Matter. It comes into existence as being an object of discourse through S4 Observation or declaration and is restricted to the time span starting after the last change through an S18 Alteration before the S4 Observation or declaration and ending with the next S18 Alteration Event (identity). A S22 Segment of Matter exists as long as there is no modification of the geometric arrangement of its particles. Therefore the temporal boundaries of the defining Spacetime Volume are given by two S18 Alteration events.
            The history of a S22 Segment of Matter started with the first S17 Physical Genesis event that deposited still existing matter within the defined spatial extend. The collection of all S18 Alteration events represent its history. Some of the events will not leave any physical material within the S22 Segment of Matter.
