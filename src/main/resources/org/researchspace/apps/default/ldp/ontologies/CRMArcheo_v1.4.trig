    rdfs:comment """This class comprises activities of excavating in the sense of archaeology which are documented as a coherent set of actions of progressively recording and removing matter from a pre-specified location under specific rules. Typically, an excavation process unit would be terminated if significant discontinuities of substance or finds come to light, or if the activity should be interrupted due to external factors, such as end of a working day. In other cases, the termination would be based on predefined physical specifications, such as the boundaries of a maximal volume of matter intended to be excavated in one unit of excavation.
Depending on the methodology, an instance of A1 Excavation Process Unit may intend to remove matter only within the boundaries of a particular stratigraphic unit, or it may follow a pre-declared spatial extent such as a trench. It may only uncover, clean or expose a structure or parts of it.
The process of excavation results in the production of a set of recorded (documentation) data that should be sufficient to provide researchers enough information regarding the consistence and spatial distribution of the excavated Segment of Matter and things and features embedded in it. Some parts or all of the removed physical material (S11 Amount of Matter) may be dispersed, whereas others may be kept in custody in the form of finds or samples, while others (such as parts of walls) may be left at the place of their discovery. The data produced by an instance of excavation process unit should pertain to the material state of matter at excavation time only and should well be distinguished from subsequent interpretation about the causes for this state of matter.

An archaeological excavation typically takes place in a predefined geographic area specifically defined after an investigation campaign or based on interpretation of sources, or evidenced by a different activity (such as: preparatory works for urban construction, rescue archaeology and similar) and is carried out according with specific authorisations provided by a competent authority. A specific identifier for each archaeological excavation is usually assigned by the same authority. The set of activities is not limited to matter removals but also comprises siblings activities, happening throughout the whole process, intended for observation and/or consolidation of the excavated strata. The archaeological excavation is usually under the responsibility of a coordinator, officially designated, which is legally and scientifically responsible for all the activities carried out within each of the excavation process units and is also responsible for the documentation of the whole process."@en;

The interface marks the extreme limit of the effect of a genesis or modification event, and indicates in particular where the effect of this event ended. Each event of creation/destruction of a deposition layer implies the creation of new interfaces.

An instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit may contain physical objects. The internal continuity and the boundaries of an instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit should  be of a kind that can be attributed to a single genesis event or process and have the potential to be observed.
One genesis event may have created more than one SU. An instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit is regarded to exist as long as a part of its matter is still in place with respect to a surrounding reference space such that its spatial features can be associated with effects of the genesis process of interest. Normally at least one of the surfaces (such as the lower one) from its genesis event will remain during its existence.
This also implies that a certain degree of coherent (“conformal”) deformation is tolerable within its time-span of existence. Therefore the place an instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit occupies can be uniquely identified with respect to the surrounding reference space of archaeological interest.

As an empirical fact, the expert may only be able to decide that a particular embedding is not recent, i.e., has been persisting for longer than the activity that encountered it. This class can be used to document the fact of embedding generally with respect to the surrounding matter or more specifically with respect to a more precise position within this matter.

These processes are usually due not only to natural forces (i.e., climate, the impact of flora and fauna, other natural events), but also to human activities, in particular, excavation and construction.
