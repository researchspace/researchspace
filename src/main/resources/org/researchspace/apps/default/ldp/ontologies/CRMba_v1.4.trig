The term constituency is used within the model with the meaning: “the status of being a constituent part”.
Instances of Stratigraphic Building Unit are, for example, a single wall or the various architectonic components that constitute the Morphologic Building Section.

Example of B4 are the empty spaces that are formed by their surrounding walls, floors and ceiling.

Instances of B4 are portions of the space resulting from the intentional disposition in the space of a set of Filled Morphological Building Sections.
