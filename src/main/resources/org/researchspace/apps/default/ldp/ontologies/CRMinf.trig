It includes evaluations, calculations, and interpretations based on mathematical formulations and propositions. 
	It is characterized by the use of an existing I2 Belief as the premise that together with a set of I3 Inference Logic draws a further I2 Belief as a conclusion.
	Documenting instances of I5 Inference Making primarily enables tracing the dependency of knowledge from conclusion to premise through
   subsequent inferences, possibly back to primary evidence, so that the range of influence of knowledge revision at any intermediate stage 
   of complex inference chains on current convictions can be narrowed down by query. The explicit reference to the applied inference logic 
   further allows scholars or scientists to assess if they can or would follow the documented argument. The class is not intended to promote 
   the use of computationally decidable systems of logic as replacements of scholarly justifications of arguments, even though it allows for 
   documenting the use of decidable logic, if that was deemed adequate for the problem at hand.  Principles of scholarly justifications of arguments are also regarded as kinds of inference logic."""@en;

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises the rules used as inputs to I5 Inference Making.
	In this context the term “logic” is used in the most general sense of the Greek term, and not in the mathematical sense only. Examples are the direct application of formal logic, mathematical theories and calculus, formal or informal default reasoning based on default values associated with categories, probabilistic reasoning based mathematical models and assumed or observed frequencies for certain categories, application of theoretical social models and comparisons with “cultural parallels”, etc. An instance of Inference Logic could also be a reference to the exact software release of a Bayesian reasoner, a rule such as “later layers are on top of earlier layers”, or even a term like “social intuition”, if this is scholarly acceptable. (after Doerr, Kritsotaki and Boutsika 2011). Indeed anything that is scientifically or academically acceptable as a method for drawing conclusions may be included for instance human pattern recognition.
	A particular instance of I3 Inference Logic would be the algorithm implemented in a particular revision of a software package.
	Instances of I3 Inference Logic not only comprise the method of reasoning, but also the set of categorical laws or axioms used in the argumentation. Often both are inextricably interwoven, for instance in a software implementation.
