    Inherent to the notion of work is the existence of recognisable realizations of the work in the form of one or more expressions.
     Works are often regarded as finished and discrete e.g. when declared as such by the creator of the work or based on the elaboration 
     or logical coherence of its content. However, works may be recognized as existing but unfinished e.g. if the creators deliberately 
     or accidentally never explicitly finished a particular Expression but have left behind partial expressions. In the absence of 
     explicit information about the initial conception, which is rarely available, the first expression created constitutes witness 
     of the beginning of existence of a Work. A Work can evolve over time, such as through revised editions. A Work may be elaborated 
     by one or more Actors simultaneously, in parallel, or over time. Additional expressions of a Work can continue to be created 
     over time. The boundaries of a Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance 
     of a concept. The main purpose of this class is to enable bringing together intellectually equivalent Expressions in order

    musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms. The substance of Expression is signs.
    An Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time.
    Expressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of
    Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account.
    The form of Expression is an inherent characteristic of the Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of 
    a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if 
    a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the 
    context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions.
    An instance of Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of Linguistic Object. This allows for the association of 
    the Language of the text with the instance of Expression by using the property P72 has language (is language of)."""@en ;

    notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used 
    to compose an instance of Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different 
    nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not 
    change the identity. An arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation

    of Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to 
    distinct instances of CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of Nomen referring to the same instance of CRM Entity 
    may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties 
    of the Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different 
    controlled vocabularies). An instance of Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of CRM Entity 
    on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of Nomen 
    establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of String that is associated with it. Depending on 
    context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in 
    the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to 
    through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, 
    homonymy is avoided. Instances of Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of CRM Entity either formally 
    (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the

    An instance of Expression is considered to be created when it is captured on a carrier other than the creator’s 
    brain. Although Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably
     also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an 
     instance of Manifestation and an instance of Item. Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the 
     recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the Physical Thing that serves as the carrier. 
     The creation of an instance of Expression coincides with the creation of the first instance of Manifestation 
     that R4 embodies (is embodied in) this instance of Expression. The P2 has type (is type of) property can be 
     used to specify the type of the instance of Expression Creation (i.e., activities such as translating, revising, 
     or arranging music are types of creation process). The type of the process is distinct from the type of result 
     even though the typology frequently used for instances of the resulting Expressions may imply the category of 
     the instance of the Expression Creation. An instance of Expression Creation may use as source material one or 
     more specific instances of Expression. When the source expression is documented this is also expressed by the

    appropriate context and exhibits sufficient organizational characteristics to permit it to perform actions that reflect agency.

    of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of 
    many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has
