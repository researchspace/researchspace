export interface Stylesheet {
  /**
   * The selector concept is similar to the CSS selector, but it provides mechanism to match on Rdf Graphs.
   * The most significant difference to the CSS selector is that, the specificity rules are completely ignored in stylesheets. For a given style property for a given element, the last matching selector wins.
   *
   * The selector semantics is based on <a target='_blank' href='http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors' draggable='false'>Cytoscape's Selectors</a> with additional RDF specific matchers like:
   *
   * 1) Matching on nodes/edges:
   *   * **node** - `node` selector is used to match on all nodes
   *   * **edge** - `edge` selector is used to match on all edges
   *
   * 2) Matching on node type:
   *   * **IRI** - to match only nodes which are IRIs one can use `node[?isIri]` selector
   *   * **literal** - to match only nodes which are literals one can use `node[?isLiteral]` selector
   *   * **bnode** - to match only nodes which are bnodes one can use `node[?isBnode]` selector
   *
   * 3) Exact match on node/edge identifier:
   *   * **IRI**. To match on the IRI use `iri` helper function, for example to match the node with IRI `<http://example.com/perso/alice>` use `node[resource = iri(<http://example.com/person/alice>)]`. In the same way one can match on edges using `edge[resource = iri(<...>)]` syntax
   *   * **literal** To match on the string literal use `literal` helper function. `literal` helper function takes second optional argument to specify literal data type, by default it assumes `xsd:string`. For example to match string literal `"Alice"` one can use the following pattern `node[resource = literal(Alice)]'`. In case of typed literal, for example `2^^xsd:integer`, one need to explicitly provide datatype - `node[resource = literal("2", iri(<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>))]`
   *
   * 4) Match on outgoing properties:
   *   * **property existence** One can match all nodes which have specific outgoing property without any constrain on the property value. There is special `property` function to match on outgoing edges. For example to match on all nodes that have `foaf:knows` outgoing edges - `node[property(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>)]`
   *   * **property value** Also it is possible to match on the nodes which have some specific value for some property. One of the most typical use-case for this matcher is styling of nodes of some `rdf:type`, but it is also possible to match on literal values, etc. For example to match on all nodes that have value `2^^xsd:integer` for some property `<http://example.com/count>` - `[property(<http://example.com/count>) *= literal(2, iri(<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>))]`
   *
   * 5) Matching on edge source/target:
   *   * **source** - to match on all edges which have some specific resource as a source one can use `edge[source = iri(<...>)]` syntax
   *   * **target** - to match on all edges which are pointing to some specific resource one can use `edge[target = iri(<...>)]` syntax
   *
   * Selectors can be combined together (logical AND) or joined together (logical OR) with commas.
   * For example to match on nodes that have both `example:Alice` **AND** `example:Bob` as `foaf:knows` values one can use the following selector - `node[property(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>) *= iri(<http://example.com/person/Alice>)][property(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>) *= iri(<http://example.com/person/Bob>)`.
   * And to match on nodes that `foaf:knows` has value `example:Alice` **OR** `example:Bob` on can use the following selector `node[property(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>) *= iri(<http://example.com/person/Alice>)], node[property(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>) *= iri(<http://example.com/person/Bob>)`.
   *
   * Some cytoscape extensions can define their own useful matchers.

  /**
   * Graph styles definition in JSON format.
   * In additional to built-in [Cytoscape.js Styles](http://js.cytoscape.org/#style) one can also use some features which are specific to RDF graphs.
   *
   * It is possible to use handlebars templates to access values of outgoing edges in style attributes. E.g. to use `rdfs:label` value as label for the node one can use the following style:
   * ```
   * 'style': {
   *   'content': '{{[<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>].[0].value}}',
   * }
   * ```
   * The assumption here is that a property can have multiple values.
   *
   * Also it is possible to use resource preferred label or preferred thumbnail with the help of `data` function.
   * For example to use preferred label for as node content one can use the following snippet:
   * ```
   * 'style': {
   *   'content': 'data(label)',
   * }
   * ```
   * and in A similar way preferred thumbnail can be used as node background:
   * ```
   * 'style': {
   *   'content': 'data(thumbnail)',
   * }
   * ```
   *
