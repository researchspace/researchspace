          <li>Uploads may silently overwrite exiting files. For the time being, there is no additional warning or check. </li>
          <li>Uploads to any of these directories may change the system behaviour, i.e. if you upload / overwrite a config file, this may possibliy even break the system.</li>
          <li>It is recommended to limited the user group which may perform such low-level file operations, i.e. in the default configuration users with the "admin" role have access to the upload functionality. </li>
          <li>It is currently not possible to list existing files or delete files from the respective directories, i.e. after the a successful upload you should copy the relative upload path for your reference.</li>

      Currently it is not easily possible to specify a pattern that is more restrictive but allows all required mime types such as x-handlebars-template, which is not detected by the browser.
      Other formats are detected differently based on the platform, i.e. see https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/issues/276
      accept-pattern="application/pdf,image/*,text/*,application/rdf+xml,application/json,application/ld+json,application/n-triples,text/x-handlebars-template"
