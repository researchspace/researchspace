    <h1>Template and Application Pages</h1>

    <h2>Template Pages</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of knowledge graphs it is important to distinguish between instance data and model data. 
      Instances such as, for example, a representation of a particular person can be typed according to an ontology (model) as, for example, being of type Agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle, it is possible to create a page for every instance of type Agent within the knowledge graph manually. 
      However, <b>templates</b> can be used to define generic views which are being automatically applied to entire sets of instance, for example, to all instances of type Agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>templateIncludeQuery</code> in the UI Configuration can be used to refine the logic according to which candidate templates are being computed 
      when browsing instances in the knowledge graph. By default only explicit types (i.e. rdf:type) will be selected as templates for the current instance. 
      If none of the candidate templates exist, the system-wide default <semantic-link uri="Template:http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource">Template:rdfs:Resource</semantic-link> will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new or modify an existing templates, just follow the link within the top of the template editor when editing an instance page 
      (i.e. when switching to the edit mode on an instance page, applicable templates are being listed in the top of the editor).
    </p>

    <h2>Application Pages</h2>
    <p>
      Application pages are those pages which make up your application, but are not directly associated with any entity in the knowledge graph.
      Let's say, for example, an dashboard page may provide an aggregated view and actions over some data in the domain, 
      but will not be rendered according to some automatically inherited templates but rather using static markup (which still might be parameterized dynamically).
    </p>

    <h2>Difference: Template vs. Application Pages</h2>
    <p>
      The fundamental difference between template and pure application pages is their <strong>context</strong>. 
      In particular, when using the <semantic-link title="Backend Templating" uri="http://help.metaphacts.com/resource/BackendTemplating">Back-end Templating Syntax and Helper Functions</semantic-link>      &nbsp; it is fundamental to understand the meaning of the special <code>??</code> variable within SPARQL queries and <code>[[{{documentation}}]][[this]][[{{/documentation}}]]</code> within the template pages, which will be set to the the IRI of the current RDF resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      On application pages, however, the native context is useless (since application pages do not have corresponding RDF entity in the knowledge graph) and - if at all - 
      dynamic context parameters need to be passed externally, for example, using parameterized includes or url parameters.
