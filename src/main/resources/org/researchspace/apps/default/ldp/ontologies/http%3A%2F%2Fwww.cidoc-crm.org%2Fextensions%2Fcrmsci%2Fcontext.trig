Its primary purpose is facilitating the management, integration, mediation, interchange and access to research data by description of semantic relationships, in particular causal ones. It is not primarily a model to process the data themselves in order to produce new research results, even though its representations offer themselves to be used for some kind of processing."@en .

    reference space within which its form is invariant and at rest. The maximum volume in space that 
    an instance of Rigid Physical Feature occupies defines uniquely a place for the feature with 
    respect to its surrounding matter.
    Therefore, we model Rigid Physical Feature as a subclass of Physical Feature and of Place. The 
    latter is intended as a phenomenal place as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue 
    of this multiple inheritance, we can discuss positions relative to the extent of an instance of 
    Rigid Physical Feature without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its 
    associated place. However, since the identity and existence of this place depends uniquely on the 
    identity of the instance of Rigid Physical Feature as matter, this multiple inheritance is 
    unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language. 
    It shortcuts an implicit self-referential path from Physical Feature through P156 occupies (is occupied by), 
    Place, P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for), to Physical Feature.
    In cases of instances of Rigid Physical Feature on or in the surface of earth, the default 
    reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. 
    In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to 
    the geometry of the bearing object. Note that the reference space associated with the instance of 
    Rigid Physical Feature may quite well be deformed over time, as long the continuity of its topology 
    does not become unclear, such as the compression of dinosaur bones in geological layers, or the 
    distortions of the hull of a ship by the waves of the sea. Defined in this way, the reference 
    space can be used as a means to infer from current topological relationships past topological 
    relationships of interest.

    An instance of Segment of Matter is regarded to be existing from the time on it completely solidified with
